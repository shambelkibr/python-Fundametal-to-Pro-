
## From zero → AI Engineer (structured path).

#  PHASE 1 — Python Mastery (Core of AI)

Language:

* Python

## You Must Master:

* Variables
* Data types
* Loops
* Functions
* OOP (Very Important)
* File handling
* Virtual environments

Then:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

Project Examples:

* Student grade analyzer
* CSV data analyzer
* Small automation script

Time: 4–6 weeks

---

#  PHASE 2 — Math for AI (Very Important)

You don’t need PhD math — but you need:

## 1️⃣ Linear Algebra

* Vectors
* Matrices
* Dot product

## 2️⃣ Statistics

* Mean / Median
* Variance
* Probability basics
* Normal distribution

## 3️⃣ Calculus (Basic)

* Derivatives (concept only)

Time: 3–4 weeks (parallel with Python)

---

# 🤖 PHASE 3 — Machine Learning

Library:

* scikit-learn

## Learn:

* What is ML?
* Supervised vs Unsupervised
* Regression
* Classification
* Overfitting
* Model evaluation

Build Projects:

* House price predictor
* Student pass/fail model
* Spam classifier

Time: 4–6 weeks

---

# 🧠 PHASE 4 — Deep Learning

Libraries:

* TensorFlow
  or
* PyTorch

Learn:

* Neural Networks
* Activation functions
* Backpropagation
* CNN
* RNN
* Transformers (basic understanding)

Projects:

* Image classifier
* Handwritten digit recognition
* Simple chatbot

Time: 6–8 weeks

---

# 🌍 PHASE 5 — Real World AI Engineering

Now you move from “student” → “engineer”.

Learn:

* APIs (FastAPI)
* Model deployment
* Docker basics
* Cloud basics
* CI/CD

Framework:

* FastAPI

Project:

* Deploy ML model as API
* Build AI web app

---

# 🧩 PHASE 6 — Specialization (Choose One)

* NLP
* Computer Vision
* LLM Engineering
* AI + Backend
* AI + Web

---

# 🎯 TOTAL TIME (If Serious)

6–9 Months (Consistent Practice)

---

# 🧠 Weekly Study Structure (Best Practice)

Weekly:

* 1 mini project

Monthly:

* 1 real project

---

# 🔥 Important Advice From Instructor

Do NOT:

* Jump to Deep Learning first
* Copy code without understanding
* Skip math

Do:

* Build small projects
* Use GitHub
* Practice daily
